# Weather-Project
Made a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript by using a weather API. Used javascript to print the data onto the html website by using for loops to show multiple days weather data and if statements to change the background depending on the current weather. Utilized css to create a button that leads to a different html website that shows other locations weather.
